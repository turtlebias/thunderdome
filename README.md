# thunderdome

## If you want to make your own version of thunderdome, I have included the base code for you to shape. Do NOT claim this as your
## own, please. Run "thunderdome.py" with python to boot the game, and check the github for updates. When you download an update, copy
## your save file, and then paste it into the new directory. Have fun!
